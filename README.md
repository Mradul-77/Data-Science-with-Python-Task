# Data-Science-with-Python-Task
This repository contains the code snippets of the weekly task assigned to me by @MainFlowServicesLimited during my Data Science with Python Internship.
## Task-1: Understanding Python Data types
This task facilitates understanding Python language and its data types like list, dictionary and set.
## Task-2: Data Manipulation with Pandas
This task deals with Data Manipulation with Pandas, which includes loading a .csv file into a PandasDataFrame. Performing operations like filtering data based on conditions, handling missing values, and calculating summary statistics. 
.csv data file can downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qrbrw3K-ZciqkBuYCEitDk2lopJy1yAH/view?usp=drive_link
## Task-3: Data Manipulation with Matplotlib
This task deals in working with Matplotlib library in python for data visualization. The code has visualized a data set named 'householdtask3.csv' into various graphs and plots like Line Graph, Bar Plot, Scatter Plot, Histogram, Pie Chart and 3D Plot, usind matplotlib and numpy.
