# Data-Science-with-Python-Task
This repository contains the code snippets of the weekly task assigned to me by @MainFlowServicesLimited during my Data Science with Python Internship.
## Task-1: Understanding Python Data types
This task facilitates understanding Python language and its data types like list, dictionary and set.
## Task-2: Data Manipulation with Pandas
This task deals with Data Manipulation with Pandas, which includes loading a .csv file into a PandasDataFrame. Performing operations like filtering data based on conditions, handling missing values, and calculating summary statistics. 
.csv data file can downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qrbrw3K-ZciqkBuYCEitDk2lopJy1yAH/view?usp=drive_link
## Task-3: Data Manipulation with Matplotlib
This task deals in working with Matplotlib library in python for data visualization. The code has visualized a data set named 'householdtask3.csv' into various graphs and plots like Line Graph, Bar Plot, Scatter Plot, Histogram, Pie Chart and 3D Plot, usind matplotlib and numpy.
Data set can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNQ7DPqqthF5a2z2EpgiZzPfckIIeZWD/view?usp=drive_link
## Task-4: Exploratory Data Analysis
This task is about creating visualizations to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and check for correlations between variables in the data set.
Data Set can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NK-uhFZTJAsbH9VLmMx80oDQZ8LGfsOO/view?usp=drive_link
## Task-5: Feature Engineering and Selection
This task is about creating and analyzing visualizations on the data set 'heart.csv' and answering random questions on the data set by plotting different graphs and charts.
Techniques like PCA or feature importance to select the most important features is used.
